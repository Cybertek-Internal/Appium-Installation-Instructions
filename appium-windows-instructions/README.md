## 1. jdk

The **Java Development Kit** is an implementation of either one of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, or Java Platform, Micro Edition platforms released by Oracle Corporation in the form of a binary product aimed at Java developers on Solaris, Linux, macOS or Windows.

Hopefully, you have already installed JDK, open the terminal and run the command:

```shell
$ java --version
```

You should get something similar to:

```bash
java ~your-java-version~ 2018-07-17
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.3 (build 10.0.2+13, mixed mode)
```

Otherwise, proceed to this [page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) and look for a *Windows* distribution, don't forget to accept license agreement! Follow instalation instructions and get `java â€”version` going. 

## 2. android sdk

Download Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio?pkg=studio), might take a while, installer quite bulky. Open installer and follow instalation instructions. Outcome of instalation process should be: ![Screen Shot 2019-07-20 at 3.16.06 PM](../appium-mac-instructions/Screen_Shot_2019-07-20_at_3.16.06PM.png)

You don't have to install `node`, you can get it from installed bundle, just add `C:\AppiumForWindows\node_modules\appium\bin` to the *Path* environment variable (similarly to what happened in stem 2)

To ensure proper Appium installatiom, run `node Appium-doctor`, everything should be green.
